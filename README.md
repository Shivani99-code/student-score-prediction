# Student Score Prediction (Simple Linear Regression)

This is a beginner-friendly Machine Learning project that predicts a student's exam score based on the number of study hours. It uses Simple Linear Regression to model the relationship between study hours and scores.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `student_scores.csv` - Dataset containing study hours and scores.
- `student_score_prediction.py` - Python script to train and visualize the model.
- `create_csv.py` - Script to generate the CSV file (for learning purpose).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

## 📊 How it Works
1. Load the dataset (`student_scores.csv`).
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Train a Linear Regression model.
4. Predict scores based on study hours.
5. Visualize the results with a scatter plot and regression line.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-score-prediction.git
